# 不要踏进那良夜



还是说个事吧，最近在同时忙着课题和转博的事，今天转博的事定下来了，之后还来不及感慨，就直接转入课题的研究（处理数据，确保正确性和自洽性）。这不，老板才刚回去，我才得空过来锄锄草。

不知不觉就向着大龄单身物理Phd转变，匆匆。

照着这个工作强度，希望四五年后我还能活着毕业，希望看到的朋友们得空偶尔能送来一丝关怀。

最后想起 Dylan Thomas 的十九句诗，它也曾多次出现在《星际穿越》里：



> Do not go gentle into that good night,
>
> Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
>
> Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
>
> Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
>
> Because their words had forked no lightning they
>
> Do not go gentle into that good night.
>
> Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
>
> Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
>
> Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
>
> Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
>
> And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
>
> Do not go gentle into that good night.
>
> Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
>
> Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
>
> Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
>
> And you, my father, there on the sad height,
>
> Curse, bless me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
>
> Do not go gentle into that good night.
>
> Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
