> It doesn't interest me
>
> what you do for a living.
>
> I want to know
>
> what you ache for
>
> and if you dare to dream
>
> of meeting your heart's longing.
>
> It doesn't interest me
>
> how old you are.
>
> I want to know
>
> if you will risk
>
> looking like a fool
>
> for love
>
> for your dream
>
> for the adventure of being alive.
>
> It doesn't interest me
>
> what planets are
>
> squaring your moon...
>
> I want to know
>
> if you have touched
>
> the centre of your own sorrow
>
> if you have been opened
>
> by life's betrayals
>
> or have become shrivelled and closed
>
> from fear of further pain.
>
> I want to know
>
> if you can sit with pain
>
> mine or your own
>
> without moving to hide it
>
> or fade it
>
> or fix it.
>
> I want to know
>
> if you can be with joy
>
> mine or your own
>
> if you can dance with wildness
>
> and let the ecstasy fill you
>
> to the tips of your fingers and toes
>
> without cautioning us
>
> to be careful
>
> to be realistic
>
> to remember the limitations
>
> of being human.
>
> It doesn't interest me
>
> if the story you are telling me
>
> is true.
>
> I want to know if you can
>
> disappoint another
>
> to be true to yourself.
>
> If you can bear
>
> the accusation of betrayal
>
> and not betray your own soul.
>
> If you can be faithless
>
> and therefore trustworthy.
>
> I want to know if you can see Beauty
>
> even when it is not pretty
>
> every day.
>
> And if you can source your own life
>
> from its presence.
>
> I want to know
>
> if you can live with failure
>
> yours and mine
>
> and still stand at the edge of the lake
>
> and shout to the silver of the full moon,
>
> "Yes."
>
> It doesn't interest me
>
> to know where you live
>
> or how much money you have.
>
> I want to know if you can get up
>
> after the night of grief and despair
>
> weary and bruised to the bone
>
> and do what needs to be done
>
> to feed the children.
>
> It doesn't interest me
>
> who you know
>
> or how you came to be here.
>
> I want to know if you will stand
>
> in the centre of the fire
>
> with me
>
> and not shrink back.
>
> It doesn't interest me
>
> where or what or with whom
>
> you have studied.
>
> I want to know
>
> what sustains you
>
> from the inside
>
> when all else falls away.
>
> I want to know
>
> if you can be alone
>
> with yourself
>
> and if you truly like
>
> the company you keep
>
> in the empty moments.
