## Public Subtree {#public-subtree}

> Looking up at the stars, I know quite well
> That, for all they care, I can go to hell,
> But on earth indifference is the least
> We have to dread from man or beast.
> How should we like it were stars to burn
> With a passion for us we could not return?
> If equal affection cannot be,
> Let the more loving one be me.
> Admire as I think I am
> Of starts that do not give a damn,
> I cannot, now I see them, say
> I missed one terribly all day.
> Were all stars to disappear or die,
> I shold learn to look at an empty sky
> And feel its total dark sublime,
> Though this might take me a little time.
