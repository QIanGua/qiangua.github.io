Genetal introduction of several problem I got during the process I deploy hugo blog on netlify.
*** First Issure: Can't recongnize submodule's position
CLOSED: [2019-11-20 Wed 00:15]
The blog theme is added by using git submodule, such as =git submodule add origin url=. Remember here
the url of theme repo to use =https= instead of =git=.
*** Second issure: Command not found and continue publishing 
Now that I use hugo to generate the blog publish file, so it's necessary to set GO environment in Netlify's machine.
All you need to do is to customize deploy's setting environment:
- Build command: hugo
- Publish directory: publish
